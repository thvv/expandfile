## Tests for expandfile and macros
THVV

setup:
-- install expandfile and expandfile.pm in ~/bin and set your PATH
-- install required helper programs into ~/bin
-- install mysql
-- set up .my.cnf with mysql password
-- install required CPAN modules
-- unpack testexpadfile.tar into ~/bin/testexpandfile

cd testecpandfile
sh setup-config.sh

-- now start testing
sh test.sh
expandfile macrotest.tpt
sh testerr.sh

---------- results -----------
- test.sh should has many small tests. all should pass.
- a few functions are not tested with test.sh
- macrotest.tpt tests the macro library and helper functions.  all should pass.
- testerr.sh tests error messages.
--- flawed because 'diff' cannot be told to ignore color shifts
--- funny error message and abort on *dirloop error
